"""Enclosing function context enrichment for LLM judge prompts.

Parses a git diff to identify changed files and line ranges, then reads the
original file from disk and uses tree-sitter to extract the full body of the
enclosing function or class method for each hunk. Appends the extracted bodies
as a separate block after the raw diff.

Usage:
    from enrichment import enrich_diff_with_function_context

    diff = sys.stdin.read()
    enriched = enrich_diff_with_function_context(diff, workspace_dir)
    # judges receive enriched (raw_diff + context block)

Design per ADR-0022:
    - All four judges receive enriched context
    - Python only; non-Python files gracefully skipped
    - Per-file truncation at 15,000 chars
    - Raw diff never modified — context is a separate block
    - Test files enriched the same as source files
