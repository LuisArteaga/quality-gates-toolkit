    isolation (issue #51). This function owns only one concern: given a model,
    its messages, and an optional fallback, drive the transport until a
    usable response is obtained or the progression is exhausted.

    Retry progression (each attempt already carries its own budgeted
    API-error retry with escalating waits inside ``_call_with_api_retry``):
        1. Primary model, original prompt.

           retries (429/5xx/timeouts, from (1) or (2)) OR when (2) is empty
           AND a fallback_model is set.
        4. Give up: an empty body is returned and mapped to ``NEEDS REVIEW``
           by ``evaluate_response``; an API-error exhausted on the fallback
           model too propagates to ``run_judge`` (also NEEDS REVIEW).

    Args:
        judge_key: judge identifier, used only for log messages.

        messages: ``[{system, ...}, {user, ...}]`` prompt messages. The nudge

# Judge Neutrality instructions (ADR-0014 enhancement, issue #61).
#
# A shared, cross-cutting preamble prepended to every judge system prompt to
# mitigate LLM-as-a-Judge biases identified in the "Justice or Prejudice?"
# study (arXiv:2410.02736) and the "Survey on LLM-as-a-Judge"
# (arXiv:2411.15594). Kept out of the judge-specific ``augment_judge_prompt``
# dispatch (ADR-0031 separation of concerns): neutrality is a frame that
# applies to all judges equally, not a per-judge augmentation.
#
# Grounding:
#   - ID/metadata bias: "your judge should evaluate the text, not the source"
#     (channel.tel). Mitigated by (a) the inputs already excluding author and
#     generation-method metadata, and (b) the first neutrality rule below as
#     defense-in-depth.
#   - Anchoring bias: judges must not anchor on any external description of
#     intent. The issue body is not part of the judge input today; this rule is
#     preemptive and documents the contract should that ever change.
#   - ADR over-weighting: the one genuinely present bias source — the
#     architecture judge receives every ADR and may rubber-stamp compliance on
#     the strength of a citation rather than genuine adherence. Rule 3
#     addresses it directly while preserving ADR-0014's intent that
#     architecture compliance remains a critical, first-class check.
#   - Position bias: a pairwise-comparison phenomenon that does not apply to
#     single-input PASS/FAIL scorers (``_aggregate_verdicts`` is
#     order-independent). Rule 4 is a harmless, intent-documenting safeguard
#     against findings being weighted by their position in the diff/reasoning;
#     per AACL 2025, prompt-level mitigation of position bias has ~zero
#     measured effect, so it is not relied upon as a mitigation.
